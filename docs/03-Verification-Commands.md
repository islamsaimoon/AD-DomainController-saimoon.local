# Verification Commands

Use these commands to verify the configuration and health of your domain controller and client.  Run the commands in an elevated PowerShell or Command Prompt.  Capture outputs and include them in the **Results** section of your report.

## 1. Basic Network

Run the following on **DC1**:

```
ipconfig /all
ping saimoon.local
nslookup saimoon.local
nslookup dc1.saimoon.local
```

These commands confirm the server’s IP configuration, connectivity and DNS resolution.

## 2. Active Directory Domain Information

```
Get-ADDomain
Get-ADForest
Get-ADDomainController -Filter *
```

These PowerShell cmdlets (from the ActiveDirectory module) display domain and forest information and enumerate domain controllers.

## 3. Service Health

```
Get-Service NTDS, DNS, Netlogon, KDC, W32Time | Select Name, Status, StartType
```

Check that essential services (Directory Service, DNS, Netlogon, Kerberos, Time) are running and set to start automatically.

## 4. DCDIAG (Domain Controller Diagnostics)

```
dcdiag /v /c /e /f:dcdiag_report.txt
```

Run this on DC1 to perform a comprehensive diagnostic.  The `/e` switch tests all domain controllers in the forest; if you have only one DC, the output will still be valuable.  The `/f` switch writes a report to `dcdiag_report.txt`.  Include key sections of the output (especially the summary) in your report.

## 5. DNS Diagnostics

```
dcdiag /test:dns /v
```

This focuses on DNS tests, verifying zone configuration and records.

## 6. Replication

If you have multiple domain controllers, these commands provide replication health.  If you have only one DC, the output will indicate there are no replication partners.

```
repadmin /replsummary
repadmin /showrepl
```

## 7. Client Verification (Run on CL1)

```
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"Domain"
whoami
echo %LOGONSERVER%

gpresult /r
gpresult /h gpo.html
```

These commands confirm the client is a member of the domain, identify the logged‑in user, display the logon server and show Group Policy results.  The HTML report generated by `gpresult /h` provides a detailed summary of applied policies.
